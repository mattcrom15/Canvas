# Canvas

Canvas is a Cinema 4d Python script that allows you to import an image from a file location and turns it into a 3D plane.


## Installation
to install, simply add the .py file to your scripts folder.

Windows: C:\Users\ "" YOUR USERNAME ""  \AppData\Roaming\MAXON\ "" YOUR VERSION OF C4D "" \library\scripts
Mac: /Applications/MAXON/ "" YOUR VERSION OF C4D ""  /library/scripts

## Usage

Script > User Scripts > Canvas

A file dialog will pop up allowing you to choose an image. you then will be allowed to rename both the material and the plane to something 
easy to understand. if you click 'cancel' or the 'x' close icon, the material and plane wil be renamed after the image file.
